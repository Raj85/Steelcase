**Getting Started**


**Usage**

The repository contains several Python files that implement different parts of the inventory forecasting pipeline:
1. Step 1 - Combine_PiecesinNetworkData_SixMonths.ipynb
2. Step 2 - Network_Scripts_FinalData.ipynb
3. Step 3 - Forecasting_Final_wTuning.ipynb
4. Step 4 - TwoYear_Inventory_Vol_Sql_DataCleaning.ipynb
5. Step 5 - Forecasting_Final_Total_Inv_sqft_w_tuning.ipynb
6. Step 6 - Combine_Forecast and Actuals_0329.ipynb

The files path needs to be chnaged as per your requirements based on where you saved the raw files and the output files

Each of these scripts generates output files that can be used as inputs for the subsequent steps in the pipeline.
